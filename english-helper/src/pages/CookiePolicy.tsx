        systems. However, we may keep your data for longer if we cannot delete
        it for legal, regulatory or technical reasons. If we do, we will make
        sure that your privacy is protected and that your data are only used for
        those purposes. The period for which we keep your personal information
        that is necessary for compliance and legal enforcement purposes varies
        and depend on the nature of our legal obligations and claims in the
        individual case. Where permissible, we will also delete your personal
        data upon your request. Information on how to make a deletion request
        can be found under the paragraph “Your data protection rights” below. If
        you have questions about our data retention practices, please contact us
        electronically by sending as an email at support@livexp.com. 15. Your
        data protection rights Pursuant to the applicable privacy regulation,
        you have certain rights regarding the personal data we collect, use or
        disclose and that is related to you. We want to make sure you are aware
        of your rights in relation to the personal data we process about you. We
        have described those rights and the circumstances in which they apply
        further below. Right to Access: This enables you to get access or
        receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you and to check
        that we are lawfully processing it. Right to Data Rectification and
        Correction: If you believe that any of the information that we hold
        about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you have a right to request that
        we correct the inaccurate personal information. Right to be Forgotten /
        Erasure: You may request that we delete your personal information if you
        believe that: we no longer need to process your information for the
        purposes for which it was provided; we have requested your permission to
        process your personal information and you wish to withdraw your consent;
        or we are not using your information in a lawful manner. Right to
        object: You have the right to object to processing of your personal data
        where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something
        about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
        processing on this ground. If you exercise your right to object, we will
        no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate
        compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your
        interests, rights and freedom or for the establishment, exercise and
        defense of legal claims. You also have the right to object where we are
        processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This also
        includes profiling in as much as it is related to direct marketing. If
        you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, then we shall
        stop the processing of your personal data for such purposes. Depending
        on the circumstances, we may need to restrict or cease processing your
        personal data altogether or, where requested, delete your personal data.
        Please note that if you object us processing your personal data, we may
        have to suspend the services we provide to you. Right to Restriction of
        Processing: You have the right to request the restriction of processing
        of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to restrict the
        processing of your personal data if: it is not accurate; or it has been
        used unlawfully but you do not want us to delete it; or it is not
        relevant any more, but you want us to keep it for use in possible legal
        claims; or you have already asked us to stop using your personal data
        but you are waiting for us to confirm if we have legitimate grounds to
        use your personal data. Please note that if you request us to restrict
        processing of your personal data, we may have to suspend the services we
        provide to you. Right to data portability: Where we have requested your
        permission to process your personal data or you have provided us with
        information for the purposes of entering into a contract with us, you
        have the right to receive the personal data you provided to us in a
        portable format. You may also request us to provide it directly to a
        third party, if technically feasible. We are not responsible for any
        such third party’s use of your account information, which will be
        governed by their agreement with you and any privacy statement they
        provided to you. If we ask for your consent to use your personal data,
        you can withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that in case of a
        withdrawal of your consent you may no longer be able to use several
        functionalities of LiveXP and our services. Please note that some
        requests to delete certain personal data will require the deletion of
        your account as a User as the provision of User accounts is inextricably
        linked to the use of certain personal data (e.g. your email address).
        Also note that it is possible that we require additional information
        from you in order to verify your authorization to make the request and
        to honor your request. To exercise any of your rights, or if you have
        any other questions about our use of your personal data, please contact
        us electronically by sending us an email at support@livexp.com or by

        minors LiveXP is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen
        (13) and we do not knowingly collect personal data from minors under the

        personal information is based on consent, users between 13 and 16 years
        old of age should use the LiveXP only subject to parental consent. By

        the guardians/parents have been provided. If we learn that we are
        engaged in that processing with such users without the parental consent,
        we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to
        promptly remove applicable information from our records If you become
        aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact
        us electronically at support@livexp.com. If we become aware that a minor
        has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to remove such
        information and terminate that person’s account immediately. 21.

        Consumer Privacy Act Notice As of January 1, 2020, the California
        Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides California residents
        (“Consumer(s)”) certain rights with respect to their personal
        information, as this term is defined under the CCPA. In addition to the
        rights we state under this policy and subject to the exceptions found
        under the CCPA, Consumers have the right to: Opt-out of the sale of
        their personal information, should we sell their personal information;
        Be informed of certain information concerning our collection and use of
        their personal information; Request that we delete certain personal
        information we collected from them; Appoint an agent to exercise their
        rights provided for by the CCPA, provided that a duly executed notarized
        power of attorney is presented and provided that the agent has
        information deemed sufficient to allow us to verify the identity of the
        Consumer in question and to locate his/her information in our systems;
        Not be subjected to discrimination for the exercise of these rights. We
        will not deny California residents the use of our service, neither will
        we provide a different level or quality or services for exercising any
        of their CCPA rights, unless as permitted under the CCPA. LiveXP does
        not sell nor has it sold in the past 12 months personal information to
        third parties for monetary or other valuable considerations. We may
        however disclose certain personal information with third parties,
        service providers and entities within our corporate group in order to
        enable them to perform certain services on our behalf and namely to make
        the LiveXP work properly. Regardless, we respect the California
        residents’ right to exclude personal information from such sharing
        arrangements and to thereby opt-out of any future sale of their personal
        information. If the CCPA is applicable to you and you would like to
        record such preference, please send us an email at support@livexp.com.

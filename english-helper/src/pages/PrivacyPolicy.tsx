        information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns,
        including information such as your IP address, browser type, operating
        system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile

        search terms, and cookie information. This automatic data collection can

        experience and to allow us to improve LiveXP and the service we offer.
        This means that when You visit LiveXP, cookies or similar technologies
        will be placed on your computer, mobile device, tablet or other device.
        We also use these technologies to collect information about your online
        activities over time and across third-party websites or other online
        services (“interest-based advertising”). This cookies policy explains:
        the different types of cookies we use, why and how we use cookies and
        other internet tracking software; and the choices you can make about
        whether we can put some types of cookies on your computer, mobile
        device, tablet or other device. For the purposes of this cookies policy
        when we refer to “personal data” we mean data which identifies or may
        identify you as an individual, which may include for example your name
        or online identifiers such as your IP address. 1. Cookies – What are
        they? A “cookie” is a small text file that is stored on your computer,
        mobile device, tablet or other device when you visit a website or use an
        application. Cookies are then sent back to the LiveXP on each subsequent
        visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie, and allow the
        website/application to recognize the user’s device. Some cookies are
        deleted when you close down your browser/application. These are known as
        session cookies. When you restart your browser/application and return to
        LiveXP, the LiveXP will not recognize you and you will have to log back
        in (if login is required) or select your unique preferences/settings
        again. Other cookies remain on your device until they expire, or you
        delete them from your cache. Expiration dates are set within the cookies
        themselves, and some may expire after a few minutes while others may
        expire after many years. These are known as persistent cookies and
        enable us to remember things about you as a returning visitor. LiveXP
        uses both session and persistent cookies. 2. How we use cookies Cookies
        allow us to recognize users (where appropriate), tailor the content of
        LiveXP to fit the needs of LiveXP’s visitors and helps us improve the
        user experience. Without certain types of cookies enabled, we cannot
        guarantee that LiveXP and your experience of it are as we intended it to
        be. We use cookies to obtain information about your visits and about the
        device you use to access LiveXP. This includes where available, your IP
        address and pseudonymous identifiers, operating system and browser type
        and depending on the cookie, also includes the reporting of statistical
        data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns. 3. Why we use
        cookies If you visit LiveXP, we will deploy cookies to provide an online
        service more suited to the device you connect, as well as to prevent and
        detect fraud and keep your connection secure. When you visit LiveXP from
        any device (mobile, tablet, PC), we collect information about your use
        of LiveXP, such as information about the device or browser you use to
        access the site (including device type, operating system, screen
        resolution, etc.), the way you interact with this site, and the IP
        address your device connects from. You may not be able to initiate or
        complete some activities with our online services unless the cookies or
        similar technologies are installed. We additionally use cookies (and
        other similar technologies) to: provide products and services that you
        request and to provide a secure online environment; manage our marketing
        relationships; give you a better online experience and track website
        performance; and help us make LiveXP more relevant to you. 4. Cookie
        Categories This section explains each cookie category in more detail and
        how you can control their use. The length of time a cookie stays on your
        device depends on its type. We use two types of cookies on LiveXP,
        session cookies and persistent cookies: Session cookies These are
        temporary cookies which only exist, during the time you use LiveXP (or
        more strictly, until you close the relevant browser). Session cookies
        help LiveXP remember what you chose on the previous page, avoiding the
        need to re-enter information and improve your experience whilst using
        LiveXP. Persistent cookies These are cookies which stay on your device
        after you have closed your browser and remain in your browser’s
        subfolders until they expire or you delete them. Persistent cookies help
        us identify you as a unique visitor. We also categorize our cookies to
        help our customers understand the specific reason for each cookie.

        a service you have requested and to provide a secure online environment.

        might request. Other “essential” cookies keep LiveXP secure. Essential
        cookies are used to: enable a user to log into LiveXP and recognize such
        user when navigating the LiveXP ( “authentication cookies”); maintain
        online security and protect against malicious activity and/or violation
        of our Terms and Conditions (“security cookies”) record your preference

        cookies (tracking Website performance) These cookies collect aggregated

        analytics cookies to test new advertisements, pages, or features to
        gauge users’ reactions. The analytics cookies we use may be our own

        (giving you a better online experience) These cookies remember your
        preferences and tailor LiveXP to provide enhanced features. Without
        these cookies, we cannot remember your choices or personalize your

        recognizing you if you are logged into LiveXP; and remember relevant
        information as you browse from page to page to save you re-entering the
        same information repeatedly (e.g. language, volume, HD mode). The
        functionality cookie we use include among others: Targeting cookies
